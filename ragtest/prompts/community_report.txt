- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the rating.
- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive.

    {
        "title": "<report_title>",
        "summary": "<executive_summary>",
        "rating": <threat_severity_rating>,
        "rating_explanation": "<rating_explanation>"
        "findings": "[{"summary":"<insight_1_summary>", "explanation": "<insight_1_explanation"}, {"summary":"<insight_2_summary>", "explanation": "<insight_2_explanation"}]"
    }

# Grounding Rules
After each paragraph, add data record reference if the content of the paragraph was derived from one or more data records. Reference is in the format of [records: <record_source> (<record_id_list>, ...<record_source> (<record_id_list>)]. If there are more than 10 data records, show the top 10 most relevant records.
Each paragraph should contain multiple sentences of explanation and concrete examples with specific named entities. All paragraphs must have these references at the start and end. Use "NONE" if there are no related roles or records. Everything should be in Chinese.

Example paragraph with references added:
This is a paragraph of the output text [records: Entities (1, 2, 3), Claims (2, 5), Relationships (10, 12)]
